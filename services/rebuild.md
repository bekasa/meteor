If you are giving consideration to updating an existing website, probably there is one or numerous performance issue(s). Possibly because of design, layout, functionality or all of these factors. Loss of sales and or enquiries is a clear indicator.

As with many aspects of our modern culture, trends and fashions change quickly. With so many visitor choices, websites have to perform to the expectations of the target audience.

A complete redesign may be extreme. Sometimes performance improvements can often be applied  depending on the existing site. An example would be where current host is proving to be inadequate. Relocation to another, more powerful host would address that issue.

There are additional techniques which can boost performance without breaking the bank.

## Website Redesign Workflow
Typical redesign workflow would be as follows.

<div>
<div>
<i data-vi="share"></i>
</div> 
<p>The first issue to address is what are the business objectives and why the existing site does not achieve those objectives.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<div>
       <i data-vi="search"></i>
    </div>
    <div>

    </div>
</div>

<div>
	<div>
        <i data-vi="wrench"></i>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>Development into fully fledged application, testing to establish all aspects are functioning correctly. If there are no further additions or changes features are locked and production environment planned.</p>
    </div>
</div>
