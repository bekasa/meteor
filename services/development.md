Every aspect of the web is under constant development, from server hardware, software and transport technology. As new technologies emerge and become viable there is an ever pervading forward pressure for more. More efficiency, more capacity, more functional capability, the demand is continuously increasing and so is the response from the IT industry.

When considering upgrading an existing website or generating a new one it is logical in assessing viable possibilities to take into account all these aspects. There is an immense selection of free open source applications available which may be suitable completely or may need additions or adjustments. Equally, there is widely advertised masses of outdated commercial software which has been around since the last ice age, often proving to be inextensible without major rewriting and updating.

Adopting either option without considering the software in relation to existing and projected requirements can prove to be very costly, much more costly than starting a new project from scratch with built in flexibility

Structured web development is achieved by close liaison with clients in undertaking the following.

1. Choosing a suitable domain name if required
2. Website format (design - visual elements), look and feel
3. Establishing the required functionality, whether simply serving pages or whether some form of user and / or administrative interaction is required
4. Determine server requirements depending on the resources required
5. Generating prototype working model(s)
6. Optimising website pages with respect to search engine and speed performance ensuring there are no predictable bottlenecks
7. Code review, investigating the possibility of higher efficiencies when all the design parameters are established
8. Establishing a caching policies for both server and browser with respect to website assets
9. Rigorous testing prior to launch
10. Establishing server failure and backup policy.
